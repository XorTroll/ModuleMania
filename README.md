# ModuleMania - various useful sysmodules for CFW

## How do I use a sysmodule from here?

  - The usage of every sysmodule is explained at their folder's README file.

## I came here looking for sys-play...

  - Sys-play sysmodule is outdated, so I'd recommend using `xor:play` instead. Anyway, its only release can be found on this repository: [sys-play release](https://github.com/XorTroll/ModuleMania/releases/tag/sysplay)
